# HTML5 SUSHIPLATE

The HTML5 Sushiplate is a pretty simple and straightforward boilerplate for HTML5 applications, using Compass with SCSS syntax to generate the styles. It is heavily based on the excelent Paul Irish's [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com). It's a starting point for my websites at prototyping phase, and it's also a way to keep studying new solutions and optimizations.

Why "Sushiplate"? Well, of course I couldn't use HTML5 Boilerplate as a name, and I like sushi. So I figured "well, why not?".

This is a (very "baby-crawling") WIP, and I hope to give it some love (and merge contributors' love as well) as time goes by.

There you go. Enjoy the sushi!

## Instructions

1. Install Ruby. Tip: do it [using RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/)
2. [Install Compass gem](http://compass-style.org/install/).
3. Config the SCSS variables in `stylesheets/scss/_config.scss`

## Using the Sushiplate

1. Compile the SCSS files using `compass compile`. Use `compass watch` to compile files as they are saved.
2. Include all your custom JS files in the `javascripts` folder.
3. Include any plugins in `vendors` folder.

## Roadmap

1. Incorporate HTML 5 Boilerplate's JS compiling solution for JS. Study RequireJS, maybe?
2. Include a simple JS bootstrap using modules.
3. Include a Media Query SCSS module with common resolution breakpoints.

## Suggestions?

I'm listening! Just don't go down the "OMG why are u doing this HTML5 boilerplate is sooooo much better"-path. As I said, it's supposed to be simples, and above all, a personal experiment and learning tool. ;D
